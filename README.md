## Bloccit 
###A Reddit replica to teach the fundamentals of web development and Rails.

Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).

This was my first Ruby on Rails project created alongside my mentor using various pair programming techniques and Rails fundamentals curriculum.

I developed this project using TDD with RSpec. Alongside learning to implement different polymorphic Active Record Associations and standard Rails techniques, I also learned to write an user authentication module from scratch, and a simple JSON API for the project.
